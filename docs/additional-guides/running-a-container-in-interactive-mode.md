You can launch a shell within a Singularity container, allowing you to interact with the container's environment. Use the `shell` command with the desired image as follows

```console
srun --gres=gpu:1 --pty singularity shell --nv /ceph/container/tensorflow_24.03-tf2-py3.sif
```

The `--pty` creates a virtual interactive terminal for a command to run within.

You now have shell access

```console
Singularity>
```

Lets try checking the Python version:

```console
python3 --version
```

You can exit the interactive session with:

```console
exit
```
